# CAPSTONE PROJECT ON GIT
## GIT AND GITHUB
Git is a free, open source version control that tracks changes to computer file.
Github on the other hand is a web-based platform that allows code, web pages, and other content like store and share code.

Below are the following command lines use on git:

1. GIT CLONE: This command is used to clone a repository from github to the computer using the url address after creating a repository on our github account.
   
   ![clone](./img/1.gitclone.png)
   Using the cd command line, directory is change to the cloned repository.
   
   ![cd](./img/2.cd-into-clone-repos.png)
   ![workfile](./img/3.file-img-Readme.png)
   2. Create a file in the working directory using the touch command or vim command. Vim is a file editor, it can create file and also used to edit file.
